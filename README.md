This project was done during my internship with Hamoye AI

What is Data Story Telling?
Data storytelling is the fastest and best way to empower you to understand and act on data through the power of stories. 
It is described by many as a skill set handcrafted for the era of big data. While interpretations vary, most experts describe 
data storytelling as the ability to convey data, not just in numbers or charts, but as a narrative that humans can comprehend. 
It builds a data-driven and transparent culture, creates conversations about what matters, and frees people to do what they were hired to do.
Data storytelling quite literally takes your data and automatically turns it into plain-English stories. 
By providing insights in a way that anyone can understand, in language, data storytelling gives you the ability to get the story about what matters 
to organization in seconds.
